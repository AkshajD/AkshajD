👋 Hey! I'm a 20-year old student exploring the intersection between human longevity, immunology, and cancer, with a dream to eradicate age-related diseases and develop prophylactic (preventative) vaccines for cancer.

🔬 I am currently working as an undergraduate researcher at the Rauh lab at Queen's University to working on a novel project developing an artificially intelligent model to diagnose clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), a pre-malignant blood condition. Further, I am also investigating the link between mosaic chromosomal loss & CHIP, under the supervision of Caitlyn Vlasschaert, PhD-candidate at the Rauh Lab.

🎂 I am also the Chief Scientific Officer and part of the co-founding team at Biotein, a longevity startup aimed at eradicating age-related diseases. We are currently developing a protein-based saliva bio-age test to equip the general population with the information necessary to improve their health and extend their healthspan. In the future, Biotein plans to expand into developing preventative therapies for dementias, which affects 50 million people worldwide, with 10 million new patients every year.

💉 As a passion project, I am also exploring the potential of immunotherapies directed against cancer stem cells (CSCs) to prevent cancer relapse and as prophylactic vaccines against cancer.

🏫 Studying Medicine at McMaster University.
